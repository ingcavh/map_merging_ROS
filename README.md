# map_merging_ROS
Map merging algorithm for MR-SLAM, tested in real scenario and deveoped under the ROS framework.

The map merging algorithm is able to detect common points (features) betweeen two maps and to merge them robust and fastly into a single (but bigger) map. The algorithm uses Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) since these maps are a graphical representation of environments.

This package is under updating, so tutorials, videos and bag files will be uploaded soon.
